ซึ่งท่านได้อุทิศตัวช่วยเหลือผู้ป่วยโรคเอดส์และเด็กกำพร้ามาสิบกว่าปี แล้ว ทั้งๆที่ท่านมีพร้อม ทุกอย่าง จบการ ศึกษาระดับปริญญาโทวิศวะจากออสเตรเลีย แต่ท่านก็เสียสละ ได้ เพียงเพราะท่านเห็น ว่า ผู้ป่วยโรคเอดส์นั้นไร้ที่พึ่ง จริงๆ ขนาดบางคนพอพ่อแม่รู้ว่าติดเชื้อ เอดส์ ยังรังเกียจและทอดทิ้งลูกของตัว เองได้เลย หลวงพ่อท่านเห็นว่า ถ้าท่านไม่ช่วยพวกเขาเหล่า นี้ ท่านก็ไม่สามารถเรียกตัวเองว่าเป็น มนุษย์ได้ ทุก วันนี้ ที่วัดมีผู้ป่วยและเด็กกำพร้าที่ หลวงพ่อต้องคอยดูแลรวมถึงพนักงานและอาสาสมัครราวหนึ่งพันคน ค่าใช้จ่ายต่อเดือนประมาณ สามล้าน กว่าบาทแต่ยอดบริจาคกลับน้อยลง เนื่องจากสภาวะเศรษฐกิจที่ซบเซา เห็นว่า ลดลงเหลือเพียงเดือนละสองแสนบาทเอง ส่วนรัฐบาลก็ช่วยเหลือเพียงเดือนละหนึ่งแสนบาทเท่า นั้นเคยโทรไปถามที่วัด เกี่ยวกับสถานะทางการเงิน พนักงานก็บอกว่า รายรับเท่าเดิม แต่ค่าใช้จ่ายเพิ่มขึ้นทุกวัน ค่ายารักษาหรือเพิ่มภูมิต้านทานก็ แสนจะแพง แถมผู้ป่วยก็มีแต่จะเพิ่มมาก ขึ้น ทางวัดจะไม่รับก็ไม่ ได้ เนื่องจากมีคนพาผู้บ่วยมาทิ้งไว้ที่ หน้าประตูวัดเสมอ ซึ่งพวกเขาก็ไม่มีทางไป ที่วัดก็เมตตาช่วยเหลือแม้กระทั่งคน ชราและเด็กที่คนในครอบครัวเสียชีวิต เพราะเอดส์แล้วไม่มีใครดูแล ตอนนี้ต้องมีการส่ง ผู้ป่วยที่อาการดีแล้วและพอมีฐานะกลับบ้านบ้าง แล้ว และอีกสามเดือนอาจต้องปิดตัว ลง!!!!!!หลวงพ่อเองต้องลงมาบิณฑบาตรที่ กรุงเทพฯทุกสัปดาห์ ต้องไปหลายที่ต่อ หนึ่งวัน เพราะรอนไปช่วยเหลือถึงวัด ไม่ไหว เห็นแล้วก็เหนื่อยแทน จริงๆ เมืองไทยมีผู้ติดชื้อเอดส์มาก เป็นอันดับสี่ของโลกแล้ว และแนวโน้มก็มี มากขึ้นเรื่อยๆ ส่วนทางกับอายุของผู้ที่ ติดเชื้อเอดส์ซึ่งกลับกลายเป็นว่าอายุน้อยลง ทุกที อยากให้พวกเราเข้าใจว่า เรื่องนี้เป็นปัญหาของประเทศชาติและ เป็นเรื่องของพวกเราทุกคนที่ต้องช่วยกัน พวกเราสามารถช่วยได้หลายรูปแบบขณะนี้หลวงพ่อท่านมารับบริจาคทุกวัน เสาร์ ตั้งแต่ 8.30 น. -10.00 น. ที่สวน ลุมไนท์บาร์ซาร์ ข้างๆอาคารบีอีซี เท โร
